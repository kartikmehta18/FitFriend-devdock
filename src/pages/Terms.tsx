              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Accounts</h2>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                When you create an account with us, you must provide information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.

              <p className="mb-4">
                You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
              </p>
              
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Subscriptions</h2>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or FitFriend cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting FitFriend customer support team.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide FitFriend with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize FitFriend to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, FitFriend will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
              </p>
              
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Free Trial</h2>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                FitFriend may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by FitFriend until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fee for the type of Subscription you have selected.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
                At any time and without notice, FitFriend reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
